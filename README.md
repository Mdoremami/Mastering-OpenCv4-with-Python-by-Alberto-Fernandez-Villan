# Mastering-OpenCv4-with-Python-by-Alberto-Fernandez-Villan
Here, I post the things I've learned through the self-study course with this book.

Most of the codes are learned from this book, and you can find the related github address below:

These are mostly the same books, sometimes I did a few changes and tested something for self-experience.
And! This is my first time posting something in github. So it could be an experiment for git affairs as well.
